MAIN OBJECTIVE -    This system will give time to farmer to grow the needed product when the stock level starting to get lower. Price and the demand 
                    prediction minimise the wastage of vegetables. Because farmers grow vegetables according to the demand. So that when the stock is in 
                    the lower level, farmer can provide the needed product without any inconvenience. Therefore, waste will be minimum, and warehouse won’t 
                    face any product shortage. Stock level alert will grant using machine learning. When releasing a stock to supermarket execute a function 
                    and get the alert through machine learning model. Then after making a prediction using another model to get the stock count which wants 
                    for next session. Those predicted counts will send to the selected farmers. Farmers will select by using their ratings. (Using an 
                    optimization algorithm). If this solution is used to predict the retail price, farmers income can be increased since they can manage 
                    their cultivation according to the predictions. When the demand is predicted, the wastage inside a warehouse will be minimum. 
                    So that the income and the profit of the company will be increased. Since the warehouse stock keeping is automated, a stock keeper 
                    won’t be needed anymore. When logging the stock details using an automated system, errors can be minimized so that the productivity 
                    of the company goes high.
                    

MAIN RESEARCH QUESTIONS -   When a stock level is getting decreased inside a warehouse, this system will predict it before it gets lower.
                            Prediction is done through considering the vegetable growth period. When the system detects about a decreasing
                            stock level, it will consider the time it takes to grow that vegetable and then notify the supplier, typically the farmer.
                            The relevant farmer will be selected by considering the best farmer through a rating method. This system will give
                            time to farmer to grow the needed product when the stock level starting to get lower. So that when the stock is in
                            the lower level, farmer can provide the needed product without any inconvenience. Therefore, waste will be
                            minimum. Our research solution can be used to predict the retail price, so that farmers income can be increased
                            since they can manage their cultivation according to the predictions. When the demand is predicted, the wastage
                            inside a warehouse will be minimum. So that the income and the profit of the company will be increased. Since the
                            warehouse stock keeping is automated, a stock keeper won’t be needed anymore. When stock logging is
                            automated, errors can be minimized, and the productivity of a company goes high. In certain period of times in Sri
                            Lanka, vegetable wastage can be identified. It can be either a wastage or a shortage of the certain vegetable.
                            Farmers may over produce a certain vegetable without knowing the actual amount which its needed for that time
                            period. So, when they over produced that using all their hard-earned money, and time eventually it will become a
                            wastage. On the other hand, the buyer who is buying that vegetable will be in a big trouble also. Which they will buy
                            that vegetable without knowing the actual amount needed. That's a wastage. This scenario is visibly shown inside a
                            supermarket.
                            
                            
INDIVIDUAL RESERACH QUESTION - 

IT17136402 -    In certain period of times in Sri Lanka, vegetable wastage can be identified. It can be either a wastage or a shortage of certain vegetable. 
                Farmers may over produce a certain vegetable without knowing the actual amount which isneeded for that time period. So, when they over 
                produced that using all their hard-earned money,  and  time  eventually  it  will  become  a  wastage.  When  farmers  can't  sell  
                their  harvest  for  a reasonable price, either they let harvest to be rot in the fields or in the worst-casescenario,they give up on 
                their lives even. On the other hand, the buyer who is buying that vegetable will be in a big trouble also. Which they will buy that 
                vegetable without knowing the actual amount needed. This wastage is occurring mainly because of the price fluctuation in perishable crops 
                like tomato, chili etc.
                
                
IT17049382 -    In supply chain management, accurate prediction of goods demand is an important element because based on predicted demand we can optimize 
                the level of stock. The demand for goods may differ affected by numerous factors including weather, seasonal effects and price elasticity.
                In recent years the distribution of fresh vegetables has become an important concern matter.From farmer’s perspective inability to predict 
                the demand for vegetables stands as the main reason for vegetable wastage. Both farmers and the supermarket face lots of inconvenience due to the lack of prediction of vegetable demand.
                When considering the retailer’s perspective, due to unpredicted demand, time to time the warehouse can be in overstocked and understocked conditions.
                That put a major impact on the company revenue.So it is needed to have a predicted model to reduce the wastage of vegetables.Here especially we have 
                to consider the fact weather.Because according to the different weather conditions the quantity demand may vary.When considering the factor weather 
                regional difference plays a major role, as different areas of the country have different types of weather conditions.Due to that reason in the different
                areas of the country, there are some variations in growing the vegetables.We should understand the seasonal effects and weather as they are the highly
                affecting areas in demand prediction.Another impact is import foods, promotions and company productions of the vegetables.So that the quantity demand of a
                certain vegetable may vary accordingly.Local demand is also another considering fact in this problem. In supermarkets, farmers should be informed about the
                needed quantity of a certain vegetable at least two days before because usually, they do the prediction daily.So toorder the exact quantity of the exact vegetable item,
                we must have a way to predict the needed quantity precisely.So that we can reduce the wastage of vegetables. Another impact is the availability and price.
                They are highly considered factors in demand prediction. It is a must to consider the quantity that farmers can supply. It can be shown as another impact of demand prediction.
                This system will give time to the farmer to grow the needed product when the stock level starting to get lower.So that whenthe stock level is at the lower level, the farmer can
                provide the needed products without any inconvenience. Therefore the wastage of the vegetables will reduce.Because when the demand is predicted the wastage in the warehouse becomes minimum.
                Since the warehouse stock keeping is automated, there won’t be needed for a stock keeper.
                
                
IT17003438 -    With this approach, farmers are directly associated with the supermarket warehouse. Without best satisfactory farmers, unbearable to 
                produce high-quality, low-price products. When a stock level is getting decreased inside a warehouse, this system will predict it before 
                it gets lower. Prediction is done by considering the vegetable growth period. When the system detects about a decreasing stock level, it will
                consider the time it takes to grow that vegetable and then notify the supplier, typically the farmer.The relevant farmer will be selected by 
                considering the best farmer through a rating method. For that, to be the best farmer, they mustbe able to better understand what the best product is.
                Farmers also need to knowat that time, what the price and demand of the products are. And managers also need to know the quality of the products. 
                So that when the stock is at the lower level, farmers can provide the needed product without any inconvenience. Therefore, waste will be minimized. 
                Farmers may overproduce a certain vegetable without knowing the actual amount which it needed for that time period. So, when they overproduced that
                using all their hard-earned money, and time eventually it will become a wastage. On the other hand, the buyer who is buying that vegetable will be in 
                big trouble also. Which they will buy that vegetable without knowing the actual amount needed. That's a wastage. This scenario is visibly shown 
                inside a supermarket.  
                
                
IT17016162 -    Nowadays the consumers are highly interested in the origin of the vegetables they purchase. Whenever a consumer is purchasing vegetables 
                or any sort of food, they tend to question whether the vegetables are organic as they claim to be by the supermarket. Therefore with this 
                research component, we address the requirement of verifying the source of vegetables by applying blockchain technology in the supermarket 
                supply chain. 
                
                
INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIVES - 

IT17136402 -    This research will predict prices of some crash crops using Time Series Prediction through Regression Approach. This system will give time 
                to farmer to grow the needed product when the stock level starting to get lower. So that when the  stock  is  in  the  lower  level,  
                farmer  can  provide  the  needed  product  without any  inconvenience. Therefore,  waste  will be minimum. This research solution 
                can be  used to predict the retail price, so that farmers  income  can  be  increased  since  they  can  manage  their  cultivation  
                according  to  the  predictions.Also,it  helps  the  Government  to  take  effective  decisions  like  planning  agricultural  
                development programs,  take  decisions  on  exporting  and  importing  crops.  This  solution  can  be  used  to  minimize  
                the wastage  inside  a  warehouse.  So  that  the  income  and  the  profit  of  the  company  will  be  increased.  Since stock 
                logging is automated, a stock-keeper won't be needed, errors can be minimized, productivity and the revenue of a company goes high.
                
                
IT17049382 -    By analyzing daily sales data of consumer goods collected from Point Of Sale System (POS) of Cargills (Ceylon) PLC. Here we 
                select Cargills (Ceylon) PLC. because they comprise records of price and quantity of each item extend over several years. In the 
                opinion of regional preferences and seasonal effects, demand may change accordingly. We proposed to predict a model by estimating 
                the demand curve of vegetables by employing a regression approach and neural networks. We aim to show that there are regional differences 
                and seasonal effects especially effects of weather effects to differ the demand level. Stock level alert will grant using machine learning.
                When releasing a stock to supermarket execute a function and get the alert through the machine learning model. Then after making a prediction 
                using another model to get the stock count which wants for the next session. Those predicted counts will send to the selected farmers.  So the 
                farmers will grow vegetables according to the demand.  When the demand is predicted, the wastage inside the warehouse will be minimum.
                
                
IT17003438 -    The objective of this is how managers actually select the best farmers. According to farmer’s performance, best farmers will select by using their
                ratings. This solution is used to predict the retail price. If this solution is used to predict retail price, farmers’income can be increased since 
                they can manage their cultivation  according  to  the  prediction. And,  there  are  many wastages  in  the  warehouse, because  of  not  correct 
                management  in  the  cultivation. When the demand is predicted using this solution, will be minimized wastage of goods inside  the  warehouse. 
                And therefore,the  income  and  profit  if  the  company  will  be increased. 
                

IT17016162 -    This research  component  allows the consumers to tack and view the history up to the origin of a selected vegetable in order to verify 
                the vegetable  quality and  to  verify  whether  the  vegetable  is  suitable  for  consumption  by  simply scanning a QR code which is 
                provided for the vegetables.For  the  above  mentioned  purpose Hyperledger  Sawtoothis  proposed  to  be used  as  the  blockchain,  
                which  is  a  private  blockchain  that  is  issued  with writing permissions and rules to guarantee access only for members that are 
                recognized as legitimate participants in the process.
